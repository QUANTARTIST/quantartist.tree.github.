<p id="explain">This visualization shows the hierarchical relationships within the Hominid Family Tree. Note that, in earlier years, the “Ponginae” branch that you see on this chart was originally thought to branch off from Hominoidea. However, anthropologists then began to discover more evidence that chimps and gorillas had in fact diverged from orangutans on the evolutionary tree before they diverged from humans. 
As a result the tree, needed to show more of a relationship between humans, chimps, and gorillas than it had before. As a result a more complicated structure evolved.
